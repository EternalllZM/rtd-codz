Global Server Rules
=====

Overview
------------
.. important::
    :ref:`The intent of these rules are to ensure members are LFGing in an ad, drama, and cheat free environment. 
    They assist in fostering a comfortable and healthy community for all who are willing to abide by them.`

.. tip::
    :ref:`Use the menu navigation to quickly jump to a specific rule.`

.. warning::
    :ref:`Any punishments added to an account will remain regardless of who was using the account at the time the infraction occurred. 
    Ultimately, the use and security of your Discord account are your responsibility.`

- **There are no loopholes in these rules.**

Staff will punish at discretion line-treading rule violations.


- **English only for all communications.**

Please only use the English language on our server so we can support our users properly.


- **Do not bait others into breaking the rules.**

Do not craft messages with the intent to bait another member into breaking the rules.


- **Do not backseat moderate.**

If you are not in a moderator position, report the content to Modmail instead of attempting to enforce the rules on your own.


- **You may not appeal punishments on behalf of another user.**

Your account may be punished if you are used as an \"appeal proxy\", bypassing proper appeal procedures.


- **Contact Staff by DMing Modmail.**

Do not ping random Staff members when you have an issue. Instead, consider reaching out to Modmail with your concern or report. Thank you.


Rule 1 - No Advertising, Self Promotion, or Begging
------------

Respect the Discord server by not selling anything or advertising other communities, projects, etc. without the consent of the Staff team.

- **Begging of any form for anything is not allowed.**

You are to not beg for money, games, DLC packs, microtransactions, liquid diviniums, etc. from others on the server.


- **Do not sell or trade anything here.**

This is not a marketplace. You may not sell or trade your account, mods, or do anything involving a monetary transaction.

.. warning::
    :ref:`Selling and/or trading accounts is also against Activision Terms of Service, and the ToS of other platforms such as Steam, Xbox, PSN, etc.`

- **No community or clan recruitments.**

We do not allow recruiting to other communities or clans.


- **No Discord invites.**

You may not invite others to another Discord community that is not ours.

Ensure that your zombies related streams and videos go into this channel only.


Rule 2 - No NSFW or Disruptive Content
------------

Please do not post NSFW or suggestive content. Do not intentionally post disruptive content that is likely to cause drama or arguments.

- **Includes profile, username, text, emotes, and voice chats.**

Please do not put anything NSFW, explicit, or suggestive on anything that is associated with you such as profile pictures and statuses. Includes messages sent that include external emotes, stickers, etc.


- **Suggestive content reviewed at moderator's discretion.**

The Moderator who first sees explicit or suggestive content will moderate it at their discretion. This means a varying range of moderations may be placed depending on who sees it.


- **Trolling discussion channels is not allowed.**

This very disruptive content does not belong anywhere in the server.

Do not argue in public channels or cause drama.

.. note::
    :ref:`Both users (no matter who started) will be punished should this occur.`

Direct message Modmail that you are being insulted/harrassed instead of trying to \"fight back\".


Rule 4 - No Spamming or Off-Topic Content

Includes RektT5, IW6x, and all others under this scope.

- **Do not ask for others to gameshare with you.**

Asking other members to gameshare_ (sometimes referred to as Family Share) with you against the Terms of Service for every online marketplace (see sources below). 
Do not ask that others compromise their account and security because you do not want to purchase the content yourself. 

    • If caught sharing your login info, you'll be permanently suspended.

    • If billing information is on the account, the other person can use it to buy lots of stuff.

    • You're responsible for everything that happens on your account.

Rule 6 - No Voice Communication Abuse
------------

Act appropriate and do not annoy or insult others (includes bot usage) when in a voice channel.

- **Do not be annoying, loud, or use soundboards.**

Annoying is subjective. Though if multiple people are asking you to stop or not do something, please cease doing that action. Do not use soundboards unless everyone in the voice chat consents.

.. tip::
    :ref:`If you frequent voice channels, it is a good idea to use recording software alongside the Discord overlay to properly catch and report voice channel abusers.`

-  **Please be respectful to others when in voice.**

There is no reason to be rude or bully others in voice chat.


-  **Do not abuse music bots or play loud sounds/suggestive content.**

Please be respectful of the bots and those listening by not playing obnoxious content or loud sounds (commonly referred to as *earrape*).


Rule 7 - No Staff Disrespect or Punishment Evasion
------------

Staff are doing their job when interacting with rule-violating Members. Please do not impede on their ability or insult them during this process.

- **Do not disrespect Staff or impede on their moderation duties.**

Staff are to uphold and enforce server rules, which means they sometimes must moderate or call out rule breaking behavior publicly. 
Do not disrespect or impede on their moderation duties. Public channels are not the proper place to discuss or object to these.


- **If a Moderator or bot tells you to stop doing something, stop it.**

If the bot posts a public warning, immediately cease the rule violation or change the topic of discussion back to the channel's intended purpose. 


- **Evading mutes make them permanent. Automatically.**

Do not attempt to evade your mute, it will only make it permanent. We do not remove permanent mutes by those trying to evade. You will have to reach out to Modmail once your mute expires.


- **You may only have one account on the server.**

Do not join with an alternate account onto the server or use one to evade a punishment. 
If you have a legitimate reason to join with another account, please contact Modmail immediately in order to get it approved.


- **Do not imitate Staff in any way**

Do not imitate Staff by means of trying to backseat moderate, changing usernames to match Staff, or claim that you are a Staff member.


- **Do not complain about punishments in public channels.**

Public channels are not the place for complaining about moderations you received. By doing this, you will only receive a harsher punishment against your account.


Rule 8 - No Cheating, Glitching, or Exploiting
------------

Respect the games and those that play it. Our server is a strict no cheating environment and you will be punished for doing this.

- **Includes asking for glitches, or discussion of any exploiting.**

Any malicious cheating, glitching, or exploit discussion on the server is strictly not allowed. 

.. note::
    :ref:`If it is discussion related and not malciously attempting to inform or distribute, it may be allowed (at Moderator discretion). 
    For example, you may discuss the Jet Gun knifing glitch or how to remove George Romero's lightning shock as legitimate strategies. 
    You may not, however, distribute how to godmode, unlock all, noclip into out of map areas, etc.`

- **Selling or offering mod menus is an immediate permanent ban.**

Do not offer or sell cheats, hacks, or menus to others in public channels or through DMs.

.. note::
    :ref:`Discord ToS states to not distribute or provide hacks, cheats, exploits that provide an unfair advantage. 
    Steam Workshop mod menus and/or World at War prop hunt menus do not provide an unfair advantage, but may be frowned upon. 
    However, this would not be construed as cheating. If you are unsure, please reach out to Modmail to ask if something is allowed.`

Rule 9 - You must Follow Discord ToS and Guidelines
------------

It is your responsibility to have read the Terms of Service when you signed up for the platform and to keep updated with it.
