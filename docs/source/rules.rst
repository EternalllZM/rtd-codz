Rule 6 - No Voice Communication Abuse
------------

Act appropriate and do not annoy or insult others (includes bot usage) when in a voice channel.

- **Be respectful by not being annoying, loud, or using soundboards.**

Annoying is subjective. Though if multiple people are asking you to stop or not do something, please cease doing that action. Do not use soundboards unless everyone in the voice chat consents.

Staff are doing their job when interacting with rule-violating Members. Please do not impede on their ability or insult them during this process.

- **Do not ignore Staff or impede on their moderation duties.**

If a Moderator makes a verbal warning, immediately cease the rule violation or change the topic of discussion back to the channel's intended purpose. 
Do not disrespect or impede Staff's moderation duties. Public channels are not the proper place to discuss or object to these.

Do not attempt to evade your mute, it will only make it permanent. We do not remove permanent mutes by those trying to evade. You will have to reach out to Modmail once your mute expires.

Do not join with an alternate account onto the server or use one to evade a punishment. 


- **Do not imitate Staff or backseat moderate.**

Do not imitate Staff by backseat moderating, changing usernames to match Staff, or claim that you are a Staff member.

Public channels are not the place for complaining about moderations you received. By doing this, you will only receive a harsher punishment against your account.

.. note::
    :ref:`If it is discussion related and not malciously attempting to inform or distribute, it may be allowed (at Moderator discretion). 
    For example, you may discuss the Jet Gun knifing "glitch" or how to remove George Romero's lightning shock as they have been deemed legitimate strategies. 
    You may not discuss how to godmode, unlock all, noclip into out of map areas, etc.`

- **Includes in-game exploits that provide multiplayer advantages.**

In-game glitches or exploits that provide \"mod-menu like\" features such as godmode or noclip are prohibited.

Do not offer or sell cheats, hacks, or menus to others in public channels or through DMs.

.. note::
    :ref:`Discord ToS states to not distribute or provide hacks, cheats, exploits that provide an unfair advantage. 
    Steam Workshop mod menus and/or World at War prop hunt menus do not provide an unfair advantage, but may be frowned upon. 
    However, this would not be construed as cheating. If you are unsure, please reach out to Modmail to ask if something is allowed.`
