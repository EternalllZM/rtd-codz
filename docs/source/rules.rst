Those who are punished are given clear instructions for the next step post-moderation. Please do not appeal on their behalf, or your account may be punished as well.

Asking other members to gameshare_ (sometimes referred to as Family Share) with you against the Terms of Service for Discord and every online digital marketplace (Steam, Xbox, PSN, etc.). 
Do not ask that others compromise their account and security because you do not want to purchase the content yourself.

.. _gameshare: https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/gameshare-xbox-one/

.. note::
    :ref:`Gamesharing is a feature meant for friends and family, not random members of a Discord server.`

.. warning::
    :ref:`Somebody hacking on a gameshared DLC or the game itself can get your account banned instead of theirs if you were sharing the content with them.`

Rule 6 - No Voice Communication Abuse
------------
.. important::
    :ref:`We simply request that you act appropriate and do not annoy or insult others (includes bot usage) when in a voice channel.`

- **Do not be annoying, loud, or use soundboards.**

Annoying is subjective. Though if multiple people are asking you to stop or not do something, take the hint. Do not use soundboards unless everyone in the voice chat consents.

.. tip::
    :ref:`If you frequent voice channels, it is a good idea to use recording software alongside the Discord overlay to properly catch and report voice channel abusers.`

There is no reason to be unreasonably rude or bully others in voice chat sessions.

Please be respectful of the bots and those listening by not playing obnoxious content or loud sounds (*commonly referred to as earrape*).


Rule 7 - No Staff Disrespect or Punishment Evasion
------------
.. important::
    :ref:`Staff are doing their job when interacting with rule-violating Members. Please do not impede on their ability or insult them during this process.`

- **Do not disrespect Staff or impede on their moderation duties.**

The Staff uphold and enforce the server rules, which means they sometimes must moderate or call out rule breaking behavior publicly. 
Do not disrespect or impede on their moderation duties. Public channels are not the proper place to discuss or object to these.


- **If a Moderator or bot tells you to stop doing something, stop it.**

If the bot posts a public warning, immediately cease the rule violation or change the topic of discussion back to the channel's intended purpose. 


- **Evading mutes make them permanent. Automatically.**

Do not attempt to evade your mute, it will only make it permanent. We do not remove permanent mutes by those trying to evade. You will have to reach out to Modmail once your mute expires.


- **You may only have one account on the server.**

Please do not join with an alternate account onto the server or use one to evade a punishment. 
If you have a legitimate reason to join with an alternate account, please contact Modmail in order to get it approved.


- **Do not imitate Staff in any way**

Do not imitate Staff by means of trying to backseat moderate, changing usernames to match Staff, or claim that you are a Staff member.


- **Do not complain about punishments in public channels.**

Public channels are not the place for complaining about moderations you received. By doing this, you will only receive a harsher punishment against your account.


Rule 8 - No Cheating, Glitching, or Exploiting
------------
.. important::
    :ref:`Please respect the games and those that play it. We do not appreciate cheating of any form.`

- **Includes asking for glitches, or discussion of any exploiting.**

Any cheating, glitching, or exploit discussion on the server is strictly not allowed. 
However, if it is discussion related and not malciously attempting to inform or distribute, it may be allowed (at Moderator discretion).

.. note::
    :ref:`For example, you may discuss the Jet Gun knifing glitch or how to remove George Romero's lightning shock as legitimate strategies. 
    You may not, however, distribute how to godmode, unlock all, noclip into out of map areas, etc.`

- **Selling or offering mod menus is an immediate permanent ban.**

Do not offer or sell mods to people in public channels or through DMs.

.. note::
    :ref:`Discord ToS states to not distribute or provide hacks, cheats, exploits that provide an unfair advantage. 
    Steam Workshop mod menus and/or World at War prop hunt menus do not provide an unfair advantage, but may be frowned upon. 
    However, this would not be construed as cheating. If you are unsure, please reach out to Modmail to ask if something is allowed.`

Rule 9 - You must Follow Discord ToS and Guidelines
------------
.. important::
    :ref:`The TOS can be overwhelming. However, it is your responsibility to have read it when you signed up for the platform and to keep updated with it.`
