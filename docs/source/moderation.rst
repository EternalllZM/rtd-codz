Getting Started
------------

To begin moderating, we will first enable Developer Mode

.. code-block:: console

   Settings > Advanced > Developer Mode

Issuing Commands
----------------

To retrieve a list of commands, run them without parameters.
Examples are ``warn``, ``mute``, ``kick``, ``softban`` and ``ban``

If you do not specify all parameters when running the command in production, you may run into errors such as:

.. code-block:: console
   
   Error: Member <X> not found
