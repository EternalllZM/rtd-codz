Applying for Staff
-----------------

So you want to apply for Staff. It's good that you got this far, because you will be required to read and understand the mechanics of the server in-depth. 
The Moderator position is not one of ease and will require critical thinking, reading, and listening skills. In order to apply, you must meet the following requirements: 

    • Minimum 18+ years of age and fluent in English.
    • Must work well within a team and remain composed during conflict.
    • Understand the rules in-depth.
    • Frequent activity within the server both text and voice.
    • Must be a member for at least a month.
    • Must have none or minimal warnings within the server, may not be previously banned.
    • Know the server well enough to direct users to proper resources. (ex. How do I add roles?)
    • Must have 2FA (two-factor authentication) enabled on your account.
    • Must be an active listener and can take criticism well.
    • Must have a good reputation with the rest of the staff team.
    • Must have a working, good quality microphone.

.. important::
    :ref:`As you will be moderating (and potentially eventually managing) at multi-ten thousand community, your account must be secured and in great standing. 
    Only those who wish to actually assist the community and the Staff with keeping the server clean will be considered.`

Do you meet the requirements? Do you want to help us keep the chat clean and enjoyable for other members? If so, you may run **!apply** in the **#bot-commands** channel. 
These requirements will be relayed to you through DMs and you will then be asked as series of questions regarding your application. After you are done, you simply wait for 
a Staff member to reach out to you if you were accepted. If you were not accepted, that may or may not be relayed to you.

.. warning::
    :ref:`Asking about the status of your application may be met with immediate denial. 
    It shows you did not read the above information and do not value the Administration's time in laying this out for you.`
