.. important::
    :ref:`As you will be moderating (maybe eventually managing) a multi-ten thousand community, your account must be secure and in good standing. 
    Only those who wish to actually assist the community and the Staff with keeping the server clean will be considered.`

If you meet the requirements and desire to help us keep the chat clean and enjoyable for other members, run **!apply** in the **#bot-commands** channel. 
These requirements will be relayed to you through DMs and you will then be asked a series of questions. After completed, you wait for 
a Staff member to reach out to you if you were accepted. If you were not accepted, that may or may not be relayed to you.

.. warning::
    :ref:`Asking about the status of your application may be met with immediate denial. 
    It shows you did not read the above information and do not value the Administration's time in laying this out for you.`
