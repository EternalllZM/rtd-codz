Overview
------------
.. important::
    :ref:`This page serves to reference as a joke database for the inside jokes of the server.`

Kindertown
------------

This meme was coined by account **memelord56** who asked in the #lfg-vanguard channel, "whwers the power on kindertown" (exact phrase). 
This meme is iconic for it not only being the worst butchering of Kino Der Toten, presumably by a phone's autocorrect; but also being in the Vanguard channel.

WaW Elitist
------------

A phrase used by **Jesus Christ** when leaving a negative review of the server on Disboard where Staff members Salt and Eternalll were called \"waw elitists\". 
The meme is iconic because there is not a single Staff member whose favorite game is World at War.

Z-Staff
------------

A comment made by **~REDACTED~** in a voice channel where they were begging to be part of the \"Z-Staff\", presumably short for Zombies-Staff. 
It is used as an inside joke to refer to the Staff team with many `memes and gifs`_ have been made about it.

A meme based off an LFG post made by **[VSM] Major Marquis** which included an unnecessary amount of emotes and hilarious phrases such as \"NO EU\".

BO4 underrated
------------

A relatively new meme from #zombies-discussion where BO4 has been called underrated so much, it is the duty of all members to agree and continually mention it being underrated to the point of annoyance.

Hop on Cold War
------------

A (now removed) server sticker that showed a `cropped GIF of Frank Woods performing fellatio`_. It soon became aware to Staff that this was cropped NSFW and was promptly removed. 
It is still used as a phrase to refer to the act being shown in the GIF.

The PPSH was never in BO1
------------

A comment made in #zombies-discussion from a self-proclaimed \"BO1 addict\" where they claimed the PPSH was not in the game. 
They then proceeded to admit they never played the campaign and only rarely touched multiplayer.

Barn
------------

A mistake in reference to the map Farm. However, the joke was taken further (as usual) and the funny part is trying to convince other members the map was always called Barn and not Farm. 
Many `hilarious memes`_ have been spawned from this pseudo-gaslight.

Dragon Cog
------------

Originating from Zetsubo No Shima game. The word \"cog\" was misheard by a member to be a rather NSFW word.

Matmano9
------------

A former (short lived) Trial Staff member who has their runescape name tattooed on their arm. Famous for posting pictures of their weed into Staff channels during their 
Trial and proceeding to advertise their own server claiming that, \"advertising to my 1K member server will help your 13K one.\"

Bundles
------------

A reference to ridiculous weapon skins in a war simulator game such as Call of Duty. Weed skins, anime skins, etc. and the people who buy them.

Round 1 where are all the Zombies
------------

Another `Zombies related GIF`_ which was repeatedly posted nearly every day by new members to the point it became memed. 
The phrase is, \"Round 1 where are all the Zombies? Round 30 why are there so many zombies?\"
