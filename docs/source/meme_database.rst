Overview
------------
.. important::
    
    `This page serves to act as a database for the inside jokes of the server.`

Kindertown
------------

This meme was coined by account **memelord56** who asked in the #lfg-vanguard channel, "whwers the power on kindertown" (exact phrase). 
This meme is iconic for it not only being the worst butchering of Kino Der Toten, presumably by a phone's autocorrect; but also being in the Vanguard channel.


Also expands into other common butcherings via autocorrect such as \"Organs\" (Origins), \"Mike town\" (Nuketown)

WaW Elitist
------------

A phrase used by **Jesus Christ** in #zombies-discussion calling Salt a \"waw enthusiast\", 
later leaving a negative review of the server on Disboard where Staff members Salt and Eternalll were called \"elitists\". Thus spawning a combination of waw and elitist into \"waw elitist\". 
The meme is iconic because there is not a single Staff member whose favorite game is World at War and just makes no sense in general.

Z-Staff
------------

A comment made by **~REDACTED~** in a voice channel where they were begging to be part of the \"Z-Staff\", presumably short for Zombies-Staff. 
It is used as an inside joke to refer to the Staff team with many `memes and gifs`_ have been made about it.

BO4 underrated
------------

A relatively new meme from #zombies-discussion where BO4 has been called underrated so much, it is the duty of all members to agree and continually mention it being underrated to the point of annoyance. 
A `hilarious meme`_ parodying the AVGN was made in regards to this comment becoming a meme itself.

Hop on Cold War
------------

A (now removed) server sticker that showed a `cropped GIF of Frank Woods performing fellatio`_. It soon became aware to Staff that this was cropped NSFW and was promptly removed. 
It is still used as a phrase to refer to the act being shown in the GIF.

PHD and Mule kick invented by Cold War
------------

A joke regarding the (unoriginality of the perks) release of Mule Kick (and later PhD) into Black Ops Cold War where players would say it is the \"new perk\" despite originating in Black Ops 1. 
Obviously, everyone knows it is not new, but the joke is to claim it is from Cold War as barely anything is original in that game.

    .. image::  /media/mdb-mule_kick.png
        :alt: Mule kick... brand new!

The PPSH was never in BO1
------------

A comment made in #zombies-discussion from a self-proclaimed \"BO1 addict\" where they claimed the PPSH was not in the game. 
Then, proceeded to admit they never played the campaign and only rarely touched multiplayer.

Barn
------------

A mistake in reference to the map Farm. However, the joke was taken further (as usual) and the funny part is trying to convince other members the map was always called Barn and not Farm. 
Many `hilarious memes`_ have been spawned from this pseudo-gaslight.

First instance of \"Barn\" being used to reference Farm.

    .. image::  /media/mdb-map_barn.png
        :alt: Barn > Farm

\"Barn\" becoming a meme within the community.

Dragon Cog
------------

Originating from Zetsubo No Shima game. The word \"cog\" was misheard by a member to be a rather NSFW word. (dragon c*ck)

Matmano9
------------

A former (short lived) Trial Staff member who has their runescape name tattooed on their arm. Famous for posting pictures of their weed into Staff channels during their 
Trial and proceeding to advertise their own server claiming that, \"advertising to my 1K member server will help your 13K one.\"

Bundles
------------

A reference to ridiculous weapon skins in a war simulator game such as Call of Duty. Weed skins, anime skins, etc. and the people who buy them.

Round 1 where are all the Zombies
------------

Another `Zombies related GIF`_ which was repeatedly posted nearly every day by new members to the point it became memed. 
The phrase is, \"Round 1 where are all the Zombies? Round 30 why are there so many zombies?\"

How do I talk in #zombies-discussion
------------

What new members say whenever they join the server and refuse to read anything, wondering why the #zombies-discussion channel is locked to them. 
Usually, the bot will auto-respond for them to read the channel description. If not, an annoyed Staff or regular member will tell them to do so.

BO3 Kino is the hardest map of all time
------------

A message sent by **Sandblock** into #zombies-discussion where when asked about why, responded with, \"idk\". When BO3 kino is brought up, members will jokingly say it's the hardest map of all time.

    .. image::  /media/mdb-kino_hardest_map.png

The greatest reason for an opinion ever.

raspperz tier list
------------

A tier list made by raspperz with the comment, \"map tier list based of nothing just felt like putting maps where they are\". It is commonly referenced as the `worst tier list in existance`_. 
Many `great memes`_ have `been made`_ in reference to this tier list.

what zombies maps are in waw
------------

A commonly referenced image from a Google search showing the maps \"Kino Der Toten, Gorod Krovi, Shangri-La, and Die Rise\" being available in World at War.

        :alt: Die rise as a world at war map... lol!

Salt's Moon flop
------------

Clip taken from a streamed game of Moon featuring Eternalll, Devour, and Salt where Salt on high ping attempts to flop zombies from the teleporter platform on Moon, completely failing. 
It has since been made a sticker and `repeatedly memed`_ due to how off the mark the flop was and immediately downing right after. 

.. _`repeatedly memed`: https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/925838630595993660/978282707228442644/Videoleap-DF365445-257D-4F9B-82E5-0355F153E49F.mov

MP servers are not as toxic
------------

Comment made by a (now deleted) user who when their opinion was disagreed with by the entire channel, proceeded to say, \"I think I should go join mp servers they're not as toxic\". 

    .. image::  /media/mdb-mp_not_toxic.png

!origins
------------

A command used that `invokes a GIF`_ to make poke fun at the ridiculous amount of people who rate Origins and Mob of the Dead as the best maps to exist. 
Alternatively, !notorigins is used when someone asks why Origins and Mob of the Dead are not on the top of someone's tier list.

Monkey Bomb Glitch
------------

A cold war exploit in 2020 that plagued the server and the (lack of at the time) moderators in handling the sheer amount of exploiting. 
Every few messages someone would be asking to \"monkey bomb glitch\" so much that an auto-reaction with a man throwing trash at their message was made.
