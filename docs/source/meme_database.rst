Kindertown
------------

This meme was coined by account **memelord56** who asked in the #lfg-vanguard channel, "whwers the power on kindertown". 
This meme is iconic for it no only being the worst butchering of Kino Der Toten, presumably by a phone's autocorrect; but also being in the Vanguard channel.

WaW Elitist
------------

A phrase used by **Jesus Christ** when leaving a nasty review of the server on Disboard where Staff members Salt and Eternalll were called \"waw elitists\". 
The meme is iconic because there is not a single Staff member whose favorite game is World at War, thus making this a pointless phrase.

Z-Staff
------------

A comment made by **~REDACTED~** where they were begging to be part of the \"Z-Staff\", presumably short for Zombies-Staff. It is used as an inside joke

------------

A meme based off an LFG post made by **[VSM] Major Marquis** which included an unnecessary amount of emotes and hilarious phrases such as \"NO EU\".
