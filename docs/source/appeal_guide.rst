Appeal Guidelines
-----------------

.. note::
    :ref:`You only get **one chance** to appeal and come back to the main server. Do not skim over any information, read it in full to make a proper appeal.`

1. **Be aware of your punishment reason.**

`Research your ban reason on the global server rules documentation page`_. 
That way you are fully aware of all the information surrounding your ban reason.

.. _`Research your ban reason on the global server rules documentation page`: https://rtd-codz.readthedocs.io/en/latest/rules.html#

2. **Take responsibility for your actions.**

Ultimately, the use and security of your Discord account are your responsibility.

3. **Be respectful during your appeal**

Staff make their moderations to the best of their ability with the information provided. Do not lie or be disrespectful to them.

Create your Appeal

.. warning::
    :ref:`Ensure you read all information above before creating an appeal. You will be immediately denied should you fail to follow the guidelines above.`

1. **Begin Appeal**

Type **!appeal** (nothing else) into the channel. The bot will send you a DM asking a few questions.

2. **Reason**

Using the `global rules documentation`_, describe your punishment and what exactly you did wrong.

3. **Remediation**

Tell us how you are going to change your behavior and not repeat this offense, or any other rule-breaking behavior.

4. **Other Information**

Tell us any other information you'd like us to know. You are not required to give us any further information.

5. **Appeal Finished**

You are done with your appeal. There is nothing else for you to do besides wait for a verdict. 
We hope that you read all the information on this page to make the best appeal possible and also hope to see you back on the main server.

    :ref:`Staff may wish to ask you questions or speak about your appeal. You will be notified if they wish to do this. Please converse with them in a timely manner and be respectful.`
