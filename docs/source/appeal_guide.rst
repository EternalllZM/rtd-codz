Please ensure you read all the information below in order to make a proper appeal. **You only get one chance at appeal**, make it good.

Appeal Guidelines
-----------------

1. **Be aware of your punishment reason.**

Do you understand why you were banned? Maybe you already know why and would still like to better understand. What you should do first before anything else is 
`research your ban reason on the global server rules documentation page`_. That way you are fully aware of all the information surrounding your ban reason.

2. **Take responsibility for your actions.**

Your account, as well as the messages and content posted by it, are **your responsibility**. 
Make any excuse you want regarding how someone else was using your account, you meant to paste the message into another server, etc. 
At the end of the day, you posted it into ours and were banned. That being said, please do not use low effort excuses that are constantly used such as the ones below.

\"I did not read the rules when I joined.\"
::
    This is entirely your responsibility and additionally asked of you to do when you join.

\"I do not know the reason why I was banned.\"
::
    You are linked to the entire list of rules above. They are also on the side bar. There is no excuse.

\"I meant to send that to a friend.\"
::
    You had all the time in the world to review what you pasted into chat, and proceeded to send.

\"I should have received a verbal warning before being banned.\"
::
    Our rules and the Discord ToS are clear on what is and is not zero tolerance.

3. **Be respectful during your appeal**

Simply, we ask that you be respectful during your appeal. The Call of Duty Zombies Staff make their moderations to the best of their ability.
