Appeal Guide
=============

Overview
--------
.. important::
    :ref:`This page is meant to serve as a guide in regards to creating your appeal. Please read all information before moving forward.`

Please ensure you read all the information below in order to make a proper appeal. You only get one chance at appeal, no more than that amount.

Appeal Guidelines
-----------------

1. **Be aware of your punishment reason.**

Do you really understand why you are banned? Or maybe even you already know why and would still like to better understand. What you should do first before anything else is 
`research your ban on the global server rules documentation page`_. That way you are fully aware of all the information surrounding your ban reason.

.. _`research your ban on the global server rules documentation page`: https://rtd-codz.readthedocs.io/en/latest/rules.html#

2. **Take responsibility for your actions.**

Your account, as well as the messages and content posted by it, are *your sole responsibility*. 
You can craft any excuse you want regarding how someone else was using your account, you meant to paste the message into another server, etc. 
At the end of the day, you posted it into ours and were banned. That being said, please do not use low effort excuses that are constantly used such as the ones below.

\"I did not read the rules when I joined.\" (This is entirely your fault and responbility.)

\"I do not know the reason why I was banned.\" (You are linked to the entire rules above.)

\"I meant to send that to a friend.\" (You had all the time in the world to review what you pasted into chat, and sent.)

\"I should have received a verbal warning before being banned.\" (Our rules and the Discord ToS are clear on what is and is not zero tolerance.)

3. **Be respectful during your appeal**

Simply, we ask that you be respectful during your appeal. The Call of Duty Zombies Staff make their moderations to the best of their ability. 
We try to work with everyone who seems genuinely remourseful for breaking the rules and does not tell a lie or make excuses to absolve responsibility of their actions.

Using the information you read in the guidelines, best describe your punishment and what you did wrong. Should you have properly read and followed all the steps, this should be the easiest to do.

This is where you are to take responsibility for your actions. 
Furthermore, you are to tell us how you plan to change your behavior and not repeat this offense or any other rule-breaking behavior.
