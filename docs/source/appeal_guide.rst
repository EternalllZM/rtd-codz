Overview

.. important::
    :ref:`This page is meant to serve as a guide in regards to creating your appeal. Please read all information before moving forward.`

    :ref:`You only get one chance to appeal and come back. Do not skim over any information, read it in full.`

Appeal Guidelines
-----------------

1. **Be aware of your punishment reason.**

What you should do first before anything else is `research your ban reason on the global server rules documentation page`_. 
That way you are fully aware of all the information surrounding your ban reason.

.. _`research your ban reason on the global server rules documentation page`: https://rtd-codz.readthedocs.io/en/latest/rules.html#

2. **Take responsibility for your actions.**

Any punishments added to an account will remain regardless of who was using the account at the time the infraction occurred. 
Ultimately, the use and security of your Discord account are your responsibility.

3. **Be respectful during your appeal**

Staff make their moderations to the best of their ability with the information provided. 
We try to work with everyone who seems genuinely remourseful for breaking the rules, do not lie to us, or make excuses in attempt to absolve responsibility of their actions.

Create your Appeal
-------------------------

.. warning::
    :ref:`Ensure you read all information above before creating an appeal. You will be immediately denied should you fail to follow the guidelines above, wasting your own time.`

1. **How to begin your appeal**

To begin your appeal, type **!appeal** (nothing else) into the channel. The bot will send you a DM and ask a few questions regarding your punishment and other things.

2. **Reason**

Using the information you read in the `global rules documentation`_, best describe your punishment and what exactly you did wrong. Should you have properly read and followed all the steps, this should be the easiest to do.

.. _`global rules documentation`: https://rtd-codz.readthedocs.io/en/latest/rules.html#

3. **Remediation**

Tell us how you plan to change your behavior and not repeat this offense or any other rule-breaking behavior.

4. **Other Information**

Tell us any other information you'd like us to know. You are not required to give us any further information.

5. **Appeal Finished**

You are done with your appeal. There is nothing else for you to do besides wait for a verdict. 
We hope that you read all the information on this page to make the best appeal possible and also hope to see you back on the main server.

.. note::
    :ref:`Staff may wish to ask you questions or speak about your appeal. You will be notified if they wish to do this. Please converse with them in a timely manner and be respectful.`
