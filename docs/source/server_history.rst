2017
----

- **December 11, 2017**

Eternalll launches Black Ops 1 on PC and searches for a Der Riese Zombies game. As such, is brought into an empty lobby for several minutes. 
Having only been on Discord for 4 months, seeks out a Zombies community on the platform. Unable to find a community and disastisfied with the state of the older Zombies games, creates their own.

- **December 11, 2017 (5:42 PM)**

\"Call of Duty Black Ops Zombies\" is created. Focusing on only the Black Ops 1 Zombies mode. Roles were handed out manually, there were only a few channels in total. 
However, member count was slow to start and steadily increased.

- **December 29, 2017**

A member count tracking welcoming bot was added, allowing us to easily view the growth of the server over time. After nearly 20 days of existance, the server had grown to 40 members.
